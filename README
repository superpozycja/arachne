                                  arachne

arachne is a simple program to help you navigate a codebase. it crawls the
specified folder looking for import-like statements, and generates a directed
graph of the parsed files in order to show the relation between sources, or to
generate a toposort allowing you to linearly read the code in order to better
understand it from the bottom up. plan is to support in-scope and out-of-scope 
lists, multiple languages, and eventually query indiviudal symbols.
